### The What
[NeoMedSys](https://neomedsys.io/) is a pioneering platform designed to streamline the development, validation, and regulatory approval of artificial intelligence (AI) models for medical applications. Developed by a team of software engineers and researchers, NeoMedSys aims to become a central hub for medical AI production that bridges the gap between medical research and clinical practice, accelerating the path from innovative AI model creation to real-world use in healthcare settings.

Our development approach is vertically integrated, using only core technologies like NixOs, Kubernetes, Docker, RabbitMQ etc. as foundational components â€” everything else is developed in-house. This strategy allows us to maintain full control over our architecture while leveraging robust, proven tech for our essential infrastructure.
