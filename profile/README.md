### 1. The What ###
#### 1.1 NeoMedSys
[NeoMedSys](https://neomedsys.io/) is a medical software technology that enables advanced analytics and AI assistance in the clinic, simplifies complex multidisciplinary workflow and centralizes core medical operations. Researchers can share the same NeoMedSys workflow-platform with clinicians and hospital managers, which can improve collaboration and deconstruct the interdepartmental silos. NeoMedSys can handle and assort any kind of medical data and deliver it as specific data products to the respective clinics; that way the health care organization(HCO) can become fully data-driven. AI models can easily be integrated into the cloud native architecture of NeoMedSys, which makes the hospital responsive to the possibilities that AI can offer. NeoMedSys simplifies accessibility and data sharing intra and inter departments by using state of the art information security and granular access control. 

 > One system for improved and enhanced research and core medical operations in multiple departments of the organization


<br>

#### 1.2 A brief deeper look at NeoMedSys
NeoMedSys is a distributed system and consists currently of three main components which in turn consists of smaller components. This architecture allows for agile and felixible development. 
- The first component is an agile, quality assured, scalable, fast and top-secure database management system which we call **MedQuery** and can be regarded as the backbone in NeoMedSys.
- The second component is a production machine learning system we call **MLFactory**, which is where the AI models will live and serve the clinics. Compliance, fail-safety, agility, monitoring and traceablity are the high priorities for the MLOps in MLFactory.
- The last component is NeoMedSys itself, which ties together the two other components on a multipurpose medical platform.

 NeoMedSys was first developed at the research group computational radiology and artifical intelligence[(CRAI)](https://crai.no/)

1.3 Ambitions

> 🚀 The goal is to improve patient treatment and care by improving the medical workflow

> :sparkles: The vision is to rally the workflow of clinics and research departments under one flag by becoming a trustworthy, agile and modern centralized system provider

### 2. The Why

#### 2.1 The current medical systems and the unmet technology needs
An estimated 90% of all medical data in HCO's go unused according to a report released by [Black Book](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/providers-underuse-of-analytics-could-be-costing-healthcare-consumers-billions-of-dollars-black-book-survey-300985491.html) in January 2019. We believe that there are tree main reasons for this which are; organizational culture, the lack technological knowledge, and [legacy systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legacy_system). HCO's are one of the service facilities in the world that will benefit the most from adapting to AI technology and multipurpose data platforms, and yet the current medical software systems are not capable to adequately support this need.

Many of the current companies that dominate the market for hospital IT systems today, are very often using outdated technology while trying to meet the needs which are required to bring AI into the clinic and improve collaboration between departments and research groups. The lack of willingness to fully upgrade the current legacy systems makes it hard if not impossible to offer a comprehensive health care system that promotes compliant, safe and efficient AI development and deployment while also bringing the data centric core operations in the HCO around one multipurpose data platform.

#### 2.2 The contribution of NeoMedSys
NeoMedSys is a distributed system that is designed to enable safe, compliant, fast and secure AI development and deployment, while also bringing departments and research centers together. The system can provide core values to the HCO such as fail-safety, scalability, agility/flexibility and improved accessbility due to it's modern cloud-native sofware designs. 



<!--
#### 2.2 The challenges
It is a significant responsibility to handle, process and distribute senstivte medical data as well as becoming a key supportive system for core medical operations, such as diagnostics, logistic and research. 
-->

<br>
<br>

> A sophisticated and adaptive system like NeoMedSys would be a major contributor to the development of new-found medical diagnostics, treatment and research through the modernization of digital health care systems.

### 2. The Why ###
#### 2.1 Who will benefit from taking use of NeoMedSys

#### 2.2 The current medical systems

#### 2.3 New medical technology needs and AI in the clinic
An estimated 90% of all medical data in health care organizations (HCO) go unused in terms of advanced analytics, according to a report released by [Black Book](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/providers-underuse-of-analytics-could-be-costing-healthcare-consumers-billions-of-dollars-black-book-survey-300985491.html) in January 2019. We believe that there are two main reasons for this which are organizational culture and technical challenges. HCO's are one of the service facilities in the world that will benefit the most from adapting to AI technology and multipurpose data platforms, and yet the current medical software systems are not capable to support this need adequately. Many of today’s systems providers are trying to meet the needs which are required to bring AI into the clinic and improve collaboration between departments and research groups. However they fail to offer a comprehensive system that promotes compliant, safe and efficient AI development and deployment while also bringing the data centric core operations in the HCO around one multipurpose data platform.

### 3. The How ###

#### 3.1 How will NeoMedSys bring about change
-->
<br>

<!--

3.1 by transformingh centralizing, maintaining and making readily available all kinds of medical data. NeoMedSys was first developed at the research unit [CRAI](crai.no) as a response to the lack of modern medical technology systems.

2. problem
2.2 health sector
- flexibility
- decentralized
- no modern approach
- old security systems that incetivises completely closing off the systems and stopping further development due to securtiy risks
- no way to work agile

The effect of improving this is improved patient treatment/care, better collaboration intra/inter departments and . 

2.1 NeoMedSys
The aim is to make AI a main component of the workflow-platform.
